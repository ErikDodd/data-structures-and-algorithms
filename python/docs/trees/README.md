# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

A Code Challenge that deals with Trees and how to traverse them, return values, and more

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

- Create a Binary_Tree with methods for pre_order(), post_order(), in_order().
- Create a Binary_Search_tree with methods add() and contains()

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

The Big O for Binary Search Time and Space is O (Log N). As the input size grows, the operations we run on the inputs
will take longer.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
- For Binary_Tree, I used the following methods:  pre_order(), post_order(), in_order().
- For Binary_Search_tree, I used the following methods: add() and contains()


## Attributions:

A special thank you to Tammy Do for her help on the Binary Tree section. I was having trouble with the in_order function
and where to append the root value and she helped me with this.

I also used ChatGPT to help me better understand Binary Search Tree and how to figure out the second part of the
code challenge. Conceptually I understood what the Binary Search Tree does and how it is ordered, but I was
having a little trouble with the code and logic for how to produce that.
