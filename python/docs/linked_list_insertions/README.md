# Linked List Insertions
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->


Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- append
arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

- insert before
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

- insert after
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
-
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->


- The Big O Time is Linear Time O(n). As the amount of values in the list increases, it will take longer to traverse the linked list to append or insert the new value
- The Big O Space is O(n). As the amount of values in the list increases, it will take up more space.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

- N / A
